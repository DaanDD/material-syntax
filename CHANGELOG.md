## 0.3.0
* Went through some PHP, JS and markdown files, compared colors to the
original and updated where necessary. Sometimes it's getting even better than
the original!

## 0.4.0
* Improved PHP syntax coloring
* Less variables now have the same color as Sass variables. They seem to have
  different class names for some reason.

## 0.5.0
* Fix small bug with PHP syntax coloring

## 0.6.0
* Fix deprecations (Thanks @vjandrea)
