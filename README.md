# material-syntax theme

This theme brings the Google Material Design visual language to Atom.
It is based on this [Material Theme for Sublime Text](http://equinusocio.github.io/material-theme/).
The colors should match the original pretty well. If you find any problems, feel
free to create a [new issue](https://github.com/DaanDD/material-syntax/issues/new)
